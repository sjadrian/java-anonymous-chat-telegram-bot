## Background
I firmly believe that engaging in conversations with others can lead to valuable learning experiences no matter who they are. Inspired by Omegle, I decided to develop a Telegram Bot that allows users to chat with each other anonymously. This application uses rubenlagus library, which utlizes Telegram Bots API (https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots). The Bot can be found on Telegram App by searching "anonymouschatprojectbot"
